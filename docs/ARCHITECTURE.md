# MEV Shield Hook Architecture

## Overview

The MEV Shield Hook is a sophisticated MEV protection system built on Uniswap V4 using Fhenix's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology. This document provides a detailed technical overview of the system architecture.

## System Components

### 1. MEVShieldHook (Main Hook Contract)
- **Purpose**: Primary Uniswap V4 hook implementing MEV protection
- **Key Functions**: `beforeSwap()`, `afterSwap()`, `beforeInitialize()`
- **Integration**: Coordinates with detection engine and protection mechanisms

### 2. MEVDetectionEngine
- **Purpose**: FHE-powered MEV threat analysis
- **Key Features**: Encrypted pattern recognition, risk scoring, threat assessment
- **Algorithms**: Sandwich attack detection, front-running analysis

### 3. ProtectionMechanisms
- **Purpose**: Dynamic protection application
- **Mechanisms**: Slippage adjustment, timing control, gas optimization
- **Adaptation**: Real-time parameter adjustment based on threat level

### 4. EncryptedMetrics
- **Purpose**: Privacy-preserving analytics and reporting
- **Data**: Encrypted performance metrics, threat profiles, user analytics
- **Compliance**: Selective disclosure for regulatory requirements

## Data Flow

```
User Transaction → FHE Encryption → Hook Analysis → Protection Decision → Swap Execution → Metrics Update
```

## FHE Integration

The system uses Fhenix's FHE library for:
- Encrypted transaction analysis
- Private risk assessment
- Secure metrics aggregation
- Privacy-preserving reporting

## Security Model

- **Non-custodial**: No user funds controlled by the system
- **Transparent**: All operations verifiable on-chain
- **Decentralized**: Hook system resistant to censorship
- **Privacy-preserving**: FHE ensures data confidentiality
